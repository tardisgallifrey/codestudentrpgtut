# TextRPG from CodeStudent.net

### This is the code from CodeStudent's Java RPG tutorial

I found this Java text based RPG tutorial on YouTube from a poster named "CodeStudent". However, his website is not active and I think he isn't either.

This will not be an exact verbatim tutorial of his.  I will change where I think things can be improved.  

I have not done much with comments.  Those will come last.

I will post my work here as an Intellij project with Maven as the builder.

This is the work of Fred Diekmann.  If you got here from the YouTube videos, I am not taking credit for his work, but I thought having the code written out would help some folks.

There are lots of things that could be changed:
GameLogic class is too large.  
Battle could be moved to its own class.
Some utilities could be placed in their own class.
Many "void" methods could be changed to parameterized to move GameLogic closer to an Object instead of a static class.
