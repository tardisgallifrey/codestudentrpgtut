# TextRPG from CodeStudent.net

### This is the code from CodeStudent's Java RPG tutorial

I found this Java text based RPG tutorial on YouTube from a poster named "CodeStudent". However, his web site is not active and I think he isn't either.

I will post my work here as an Intellij project with Maven as the builder.
